        <p>
            Welcome to the class! My name is Shane Panter and I will be your instructor for this course.
            For many students, this will be the first time you have been exposed to web development topics.
            This course has been designed to take someone who has never seen these concepts before to being
            able to produce relatively complex programs in 16 weeks. This class is a three credit course
            and it is specifically designed to require 8 to 10 hours of work each week. In order to succeed
            in the course, it will be critical for you to manage your time effectively and keep up with
            the reading and lab activities. Please take some time to get familiar with the course website.
            Pay close attention to when the homework assignments are due to ensure you get everything in on time.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will be interacting with each other primarily through Github, discussion forums, and videos.
            Get started by completing the Course Introduction homework below!
        </p>
        <h3>Catalog Description</h3>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Email Policy</h3>
        <p>
            BroncoMail is the official communication channel through which all university business is conducted.
            It is expected that you access and read university communications two or three times per week. For
            more information see the University Policy on Student Email Communications
            <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/policy-title-student-e-mail-communications/">(Policy
                2280)</a>.
            <strong>Your instructor will not respond to any emails sent from personal accounts such as Gmail or
                Yahoo.</strong>

    <!-- Grading policy, Can I still pass, Incomplete, late work policy, extra cred, standing -->
    <section id="grading">
        <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Final grades will be assigned with the formula [Earned Points]/[Total Points].
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if you earn 760 points out of 1000 points offered your grade would
            be a 76%. So your final letter grade will be a C according to the chart below.
            <strong>Grades will not be rounded</strong>, if you are on a grade boundary please see the
            extra credit section below for opportunities to improve your grade.
        </p>
        <!-- Figure out grading table -->

        <h3>Can I still pass?</h3>
        <p>
            The passing grade for courses in the Computer Science Department is 70%. So we
            can calculate the absolute minimum number of points that you need to earn in this
            course as 701. To know if you still can pass the course all you need to do is take
            your current grade and then add in any points that you could still earn before the
            end of the semester. If that number is below 701 then it is not mathematically
            possible for you to pass the class.
        </p>

        <h3>Incomplete</h3>
        <p>
            Instructors can enter a grade of I—for incomplete—if both of the following conditions are present:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have completed either 80% of the course or 80% of the coursework.</li>
            <li>Extenuating circumstances make it impossible for you to complete the course before the end of the
                semester.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Be aware that the University considers an extenuating circumstance to be along the lines of "I was in the
            hospital for the last 2 weeks in a coma". More information can be found on the
            <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/degree-requirements/grades/">registrar's</a>
            page.
        </p>

        <h3>Late Work Policy</h3>
        <p>
            All assignments can be submitted up to <strong>3 days late without penalty</strong>, after 3 days past
            the due date absolutely no work will be accepted under any circumstances. No work will be accepted after
            the <strong>last day of course instruction</strong>, the semester has to end at some point so plan
            accordingly. Work submitted 1 second late is treated the same as work submitted 1 day late. You can find
            the last day of course instruction at the
            <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/boise-state-academic-calendars/">registrar</a>
            . Plenty of extra credit is offered to offset any missed assignment(s).
        </p>

        <h3>Extra Credit</h3>
        <p>
            Standing extra credit is always offered to allow students to bump their grade up if they are on a grading
            boundary so please take advantage of any extra credit offered. Any extra credit given over the semester
            can not exceed 2.5% of the total points offered. For example, the maximum number of extra credit points
            that you can earn if the total points offered is 1000 would be 25.
        </p>
        <h4>Typos and Bugs</h4>
        <p>
            If you find any typos or bugs in the course materials email me what you found. You can claim this extra
            credit as many times as you wish (up to the maximum number of points).

    <!-- Computer lab, discussion board, attendance policy -->
    <section id="collaboration">
        <h2>Class Resources</h2>
        <h3>Computer Lab</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://cs481.boisestate.edu/ccp-tour/index.html">The Kount Computer Tutoring Center (CCP 241):</a>
            This lab is accessible 24/7 by proxy card access to all students enrolled in CS courses. Machines in the
            Kount Computer Tutoring Center have all the software you will need this semester. You can use the lab
            remotely via ssh (onyx.boisestate.edu) and use command line tools such as VIM.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to work on your personal machine the following setup is recommended:
        <ul>
            <li>OS - Linux</li>
            <li>Hardware - Minimum of 4GB of Ram (8GB preferred) and an i5 or equivalent processor</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Discussion Board</h3>
        <p>
            We will be using an online discussion board for this course. Rather than emailing questions to me, please
            post your questions on the discussion board and get replies from myself as well as your classmates! You can
            also post private messages to me. You are expected to log onto the board at least once a week and read all
            the posts.
        </p>

        <h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
        <p>
            There is no grade associated with attending class. However, if the behavior of a student impacts other
            students ability to learn there could be an impact to your final grade. It is the student's responsibility
            to make up any work missed during class within the prescribed late work policy window.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Don't come into class sick!</strong> There is no reason to come to class sick under any
            circumstances. Most of the material is available online either in video or text format so you can easily
            catch up on anything that you may have missed in class!
        </p>

    <!-- Academic Honesty, Institutional policy -->
    <section id="institution">
        <h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
        <p>
            Programming assignments require the implementation of working programs using the language constructs and
            techniques introduced in class. Programs must execute and compile on the operating system and compiler
            specified. Students are expected to work on their own unless explicitly instructed otherwise. Students who
            allow their work to be copied will be written up along with the student who copied. Cheating is grounds for
            immediate failure of the course. This includes trying to find answers to problems, programs, exams or
            providing (directly or indirectly) your completed assignments to other students. Uploading solutions to
            sites such as <a href="chegg.com">cheeg.com</a> is also considered an academic honesty violation and will be
            reported to the dean of students.
        </p>
        <p>
            Boise State promotes Academic Excellence as a core Shared Value upholding the virtue of honesty in the
            pursuit of knowledge. Behaving with integrity and honesty is a hallmark of a Boise State University
            graduate. The conferring of a degree represents the University's indication that the recipient has engaged
            in academic work that is representative of her/his own efforts and that was completed with integrity and
            honesty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upholding academic integrity in all assignments provides students with the opportunity to engage with the
            material being investigated and assert their evidence based findings. This behavior demonstrates the
            commitment to learning and preparation necessary for a successful future. All work you submit must represent
            your own ideas and effort or be cited including any material you wrote for another course; when work does
            not, it is academic dishonesty. <strong>Academic dishonesty in any form may result in failure in the course
                or dismissal from the Program and/or the University.</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Institutional Policy</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Please review the <a href="example.com">academic-integrity</a> policy set by the university. Violations
                of this policy will result in the student receiving a failing grade (F) for the course.</li>
            <li>It is expected that all students <a href="example.com">read</a> and follow the University policy 2020.
                Any violation of University policy 2020 can result in the student being removed from the class
                discussion and study groups. The students' participation score will be set to 0 and no alternative
                assignment will be given. Egregious behavior will be reported to the <a href="example.com">dean of
                    students</a> for additional sanctions which can include receiving a failing grade (F) in the course.
            </li>
