            <p>
                Welcome to the class! My name is Shane Panter and I will be your instructor for this course. 
                For many students, this will be the first time you have been exposed to web development topics. 
                This course has been designed to take someone who has never seen these concepts before to being 
                able to produce relatively complex programs in 16 weeks. This class is a three credit course 
                and it is specifically designed to require 8 to 10 hours of work each week. In order to succeed
                in the course, it will be critical for you to manage your time effectively and keep up with 
                the reading and lab activities. Please take some time to get familiar with the course website.
                Pay close attention to when the homework assignments are due to ensure you get everything in on time.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will be interacting with each other primarily through Github, discussion forums, and videos. 
                Get started by completing the Course Introduction homework below!

            <h3>Catalog Description</h3>
            <p>
                CS 401 INTRODUCTION TO WEB DEVELOPMENT (3-0-3)(F). An introduction to the technologies used for 
                client-side and server-side web development. Learn the fundamentals behind competing web technologies, 
                best practices for design and usability, and build rich, dynamic, n-tier secure web applications. 
                PREREQ: CS 321.
            </p>
            <h3>Email Policy</h3>
            <p>
                BroncoMail is the official communication channel through which all university business is conducted.
                It is expected that you access and read university communications two or three times per week. For 
                more information see the University Policy on Student Email Communications 
                <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/policy-title-student-e-mail-communications/">(Policy 2280)</a>.
                <strong>Your instructor will not respond to any emails sent from personal accounts such as Gmail or Yahoo.</strong>

        <!-- Grading policy, Can I still pass, Incomplete, late work policy, extra cred, standing -->
        <section id="grading">
            <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
            <p>
                Final grades will be assigned with the formula [Earned Points]/[Total Points].
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you earn 760 points out of 1000 points offered your grade would
                be a 76%. So your final letter grade will be a C according to the chart below. 
                <strong>Grades will not be rounded</strong>, if you are on a grade boundary please see the 
                extra credit section below for opportunities to improve your grade.
            </p>
            <!-- Figure out grading table -->

            <h3>Can I still pass?</h3>
            <p>
                The passing grade for courses in the Computer Science Department is 70%. So we 
                can calculate the absolute minimum number of points that you need to earn in this 
                course as 701. To know if you still can pass the course all you need to do is take 
                your current grade and then add in any points that you could still earn before the 
                end of the semester. If that number is below 701 then it is not mathematically 
                possible for you to pass the class.
            </p>

            <h3>Incomplete</h3>
            <p>
                Instructors can enter a grade of I—for incomplete—if both of the following conditions are present:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have completed either 80% of the course or 80% of the coursework.</li>
                <li>Extenuating circumstances make it impossible for you to complete the course before the end of the semester.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Be aware that the University considers an extenuating circumstance to be along the lines of "I was in the 
                hospital for the last 2 weeks in a coma". More information can be found on the 
                <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/degree-requirements/grades/">registrar's</a>
                page.
            </p>

            <h3>Late Work Policy</h3>
            <p>
                All assignments can be submitted up to <strong>3 days late without penalty</strong>, after 3 days past 
                the due date absolutely no work will be accepted under any circumstances. No work will be accepted after 
                the <strong>last day of course instruction</strong>, the semester has to end at some point so plan 
                accordingly. Work submitted 1 second late is treated the same as work submitted 1 day late. You can find 
                the last day of course instruction at the 
                <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar/boise-state-academic-calendars/">registrar</a>
                . Plenty of extra credit is offered to offset any missed assignment(s).
            </p>

            <h3>Extra Credit</h3>
            <p>
                Standing extra credit is always offered to allow students to bump their grade up if they are on a grading 
                boundary so please take advantage of any extra credit offered. Any extra credit given over the semester 
                can not exceed 2.5% of the total points offered. For example, the maximum number of extra credit points 
                that you can earn if the total points offered is 1000 would be 25.
            </p>
            <h4>Typos and Bugs</h4>
            <p>
                If you find any typos or bugs in the course materials email me what you found. You can claim this extra 
                credit as many times as you wish (up to the maximum number of points).
